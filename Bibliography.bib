pages="45--57",
abstract="This chapter illustrates the main cross-platform cloud application programming interfaces and how they can solve interoperability and portability issues by bringing uniformity and standardization to cloud. This chapter provides an overview of initiatives that provide cross-platform-based cloud APIs such as DeltaCloud, SimpleCloud, JCloud, libcloud, and also research projects whose aim is to provide multicloud APIs (such as mOSAIC). Such APIs are positioned with respect to the use case scenarios and features defined in Chap. 1, and tested by analyzing their application to the case study illustrated in Chap. 1.",
