# Development

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js version >= 14.15.0
- Postgres version >= 13

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api.git
   cd cloud-pricing-api
   ```

2. Use the [Infracost CLI](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) to get an API key so your self-hosted Cloud Pricing API can download the latest pricing data from us:

   ```sh
   infracost auth login
   ```

   The key is saved in `~/.config/infracost/credentials.yml`.

3. Generate a 32 character API token that your Infracost CLI users will use to authenticate when calling your self-hosted Cloud Pricing API. If you ever need to rotate the API key, you can simply update this environment variable and restart the application.

   ```sh
   export SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY=$(cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)
   echo "SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY=$SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY"
   ```

4. Add a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```sh
   # Don't forget to run `CREATE DATABASE cloud_pricing;` first.
   POSTGRES_URI=postgresql://postgres:my_password@localhost:5432/cloud_pricing

   # The Infracost API from Step 2, used to download pricing data from us.
   INFRACOST_API_KEY=<API Key from Step 2>

   # The API key you generated in step 3, used to authenticate Infracost CLI users with your self-hosted Cloud Pricing API.
   SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY=<API Key from Step 3>
   ```

5. Install the npm packages:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

6. Download the pricing data, this can take a few minutes. The second command will show the number of products in the DB (each product has multiple prices).

   ```sh
   npm run job:init:dev && npm run data:status:dev
   ```

   If there are DB changes, run `npm run db:setup:dev` to apply them. The init job runs this too so this should only be needed if you haven't run that recently.

7. Prices can be kept up-to-date by running the update job once a week, for example from cron:

   ```sh
   npm run job:update:dev

   # Cron: add a cron job to run every week to update the database data. The cron entry should look something like:
   0 4 * * SUN npm run-script job:update >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

8. Start the server:

   In development mode:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   In production mode:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

   `curl -i http://localhost:4000/health` should show success.

9. To configure the Infracost CLI to use your self-hosted Cloud Pricing API, you can use:

   ```sh
   export INFRACOST_PRICING_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000
   export INFRACOST_API_KEY=$SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY

   infracost breakdown --path /path/to/code
   ```

   You can also access the GraphQL Playground at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) using something like the [modheader](https://bewisse.com/modheader/) browser extension so you can set the custom HTTP header `X-API-KEY` to your `SELF_HOSTED_INFRACOST_API_KEY`.

# Release

[@alikhajeh1](https://github.com/alikhajeh1) and [@aliscott](https://github.com/aliscott) rotate release responsibilities between them.

1. In `package.json` update `version`, run `npm install` and push to master.
2. In the cloud-pricing-api repo, run `git tag vx.y.z && git push origin vx.y.z`
3. Wait for the GH Actions to complete as that creates/pushes the docker tag.
4. Goto https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api/compare and find the diff between the latest and the previous version so you can create a description for the GitHub Release.
5. Click Releases > Draft New Release button, set the `vx.y.z` value in the tag name and release title. Also add the release description from step 4 and click on publish.
6. Follow the Helm chart [release steps](https://github.com/infracost/helm-charts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
7. Announce the release in the infracost-community Slack announcements channel.
8. Update the docs repo with any required changes.
9. Close addressed issues and tag anyone who liked/commented in them to tell them it's live in version X.
